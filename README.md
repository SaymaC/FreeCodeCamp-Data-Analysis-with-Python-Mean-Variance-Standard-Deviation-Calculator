# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This is a project completed as part of the **FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification**.  
The goal is to implement a function that calculates key statistics (mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum) for a 3×3 matrix.

## Project Description
- Implemented a function `calculate()` that:
  - Reshapes a list of 9 numbers into a **3×3 NumPy array**.
  - Computes statistical measures across:
    - **Columns (axis=0)**  
    - **Rows (axis=1)**  
    - **Entire matrix**  
- Returns the results as a dictionary containing lists of values for each measure.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **NumPy*

## Skills Demonstrated
Python Programming
NumPy for numerical operations
Data reshaping & matrix operations
Statistical calculations
